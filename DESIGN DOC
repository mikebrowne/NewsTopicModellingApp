DESIGN DOC
----------

This is a restructure of the NewsApp. After getting a smaller data scraping app to work, it
seemed appropriate to simply start from a blank slate and build up from a functioning
program.

* Build out the base functioning web app
    * Basically a copy of my private "FlaskWithWebScraper" repo.
* Once the base is full functional, there will be several steps to implement the project:
    1. [x] Merge the original data scraping script for "BusinessWire"
    2. [x] Implement the API functionality
    3. TODO: Build Exception Handling to ensure the following:
        * Company is a biopharmaceutical company
        * Company Exists
        * If there is no news for the company, states so
    4. TODO: Implement the data warehouse
    5. TODO: Implement the topic modelling
