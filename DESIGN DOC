DESIGN DOC
----------

I am re-building my News App because I was unable to get the data scraper to function
with the way the structure was. After getting a smaller data scraping app to work, it
seemed appropriate to simply start from a blank slate and build up from a functioning
program.

-------------
* Build out the base functioning web app
    * Basically a copy of my private "FlaskWithWebScraper" repo.
* Once the base is full functional, there will be several steps to implement the project:
    1. [x] Merge the original data scraping script for "BusinessWire"
    2. TODO: Implement the API functionality
    3. TODO: Implement the data warehouse
    4. TODO: Implement the topic modelling
